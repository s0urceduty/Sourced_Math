Sourced Math is a comprehensive computational mathematics library that unifies all 114 Sourceduty frameworks into a structured, modular Python ecosystem. The library is designed to operate across logical systems, signal processing, optimization theory, forecasting models, quantum computation, adaptive control systems, and multi-domain simulations. At its core, Sourced Math integrates symbolic reasoning (e.g., Truthvar, OpLog, Optimation_Theorem), numerical modeling (e.g., Quadexpo, Inversonic, Radicant), and structural transformations (e.g., Transmute_T, PreJunc, Abstract_Away) into a single interoperable architecture. This allows users to move seamlessly between algebraic manipulation, probabilistic modeling, dynamic simulations, and constraint-based optimization without leaving the framework. The inclusion of hybrid models such as explogint, Fractal_Function, and Oscillant_Function enables nonlinear, oscillatory, and asymptotic systems to be represented with high expressive flexibility. Additionally, built-in sensitivity analysis (SensVar), impact quantification (ImpactQ, Info_Impact), and computational evaluation (Computation_Percent, Complex_Forecast) allow users to measure not only results, but also performance and structural influence.

Beyond pure mathematics, Sourced Math extends into real-time adaptive systems and intelligent computation. Functions such as RealResp, Q_Neuron, and Quantum_Gradient_Descent enable neural and quantum-inspired learning processes, while Navisol, Linear_Matrix_Signal, and Signal_Optimate support robotic navigation and signal optimization. Resource allocation and fairness modeling are handled through frameworks like Modbias, DistribuTar, and Weighted_State, ensuring ethical and efficient optimization across competing domains. The library is built around the principle of universal orchestration (Universal_Organization), meaning that any function can be nested, chained, or coordinated within larger workflows. As a result, Sourced Math functions not merely as a collection of mathematical utilities, but as a scalable computational engine capable of modeling logical systems, physical processes, abstract structures, and adaptive intelligent environments within a unified mathematical language.

Prototype Lib
------------

Sourced Math is currently positioned as a prototype PyPI library designed to unify the full suite of 114 Sourceduty mathematical frameworks into a distributable, installable Python package for research, experimentation, and advanced systems modeling. As a prototype, it serves as a foundational release that demonstrates architectural cohesion, modular function interoperability, and extensible design rather than final production-level optimization. The package is structured to support scalable namespace organization (e.g., sourcedmath.optimization, sourcedmath.signal, sourcedmath.logic, sourcedmath.quantum, sourcedmath.simulation), allowing users to selectively import frameworks or integrate the entire computational ecosystem into larger analytical pipelines. In this early-stage release, emphasis is placed on API consistency, mathematical correctness, and cross-function chaining capabilities—enabling developers, mathematicians, and systems engineers to experiment with hybrid models such as quantum-gradient optimization combined with adaptive signal weighting or fairness-aware allocation layered over dynamic growth forecasting. Documentation includes structured docstrings, LaTeX-rendered equations for formal definitions, and prototype examples demonstrating workflow orchestration across multiple function classes. While performance benchmarking, compiled acceleration layers, and large-scale distributed execution remain areas for future development, this prototype PyPI version establishes Sourced Math as a unified mathematical engine framework, offering a novel blend of symbolic logic, nonlinear modeling, optimization theory, and adaptive computation within a single installable Python environment.
